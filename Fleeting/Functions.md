Single variables with $y = f(x)$ have a domain and range that is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Two variables with $z = f(x, y)$ have a domain that is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$, whereas the range is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. This continues so on to the formal definition. 

## Formal Definition
For the number of variables, the domain would be a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for any n variables and the range is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. In other words, $f: \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. The set of $(x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n})$ on which $f(x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n})$ can be defined as the domain of $f(x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n})$. The set of points that can be obtained by the function is the range. 
```ad-note
#### Domain Notation
The notation for domain is $D_{f} = \{(x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n})\in \mathbb{R}^n; f(x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n})\text{ is defined}\}$
```

```ad-note
#### Range Notation
The notation for range is $R_{f} = \{f(x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n}); (x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n}) \in D_{f}\}$. 
```

```ad-example
#### Find the domain and range
$f(x, y) = \sqrt{ x^{2} + y^{2} }$
$$x^{2} + y^{2} ≥ 0$$
is always true
#### Answer
#### $$D_{f} = \mathbb{R}^{2}$$
#### $$R_{f} = [0, \infty)$$
```

```ad-example
#### Find the domain and range
$Z = g(x, y) = \sqrt{ 4 - x^{2} - y^{2} }$
$$4 - x^{2} - y^{2} ≥ 0 \implies 4 ≥ x^{2} + y^{2}$$
#### Answer
#### $$D_{g} = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^{2}; x^{2} + y^{2} ≤ 4\}$$
#### $$R_{g} = [0, 2] = \{z; 0 ≤ z ≤ 2\}$$
```
