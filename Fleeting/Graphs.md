The set of all points $(x, y, f(x, y))$ in space for all $(x, y)$ in the domain of function $f$ is the graph of $f$. This is also called the surface $z = f(x, y)$. 

## Analysis
Analysis of graphs is done with traces, namely, vertical and horizontal traces, and level curves. 
```ad-note
#### Traces
Traces are intersections of graphs with a flat plane. It's best to think of them like 2D slice of a 3D object.
Vertical traces have planes $\{x = a\}$ and $\{y = b\}$.
Horizontal traces have planes $z = c$.

```ad-note
#### Level Curves
 Level curves are the projections of the z level of a horizontal trace with $f(x, y) = c$. 
```

## More than Two Variables
Functions with more than two variables are no longer able to be graphed. A function $f(x, y, z)$ can be plotted in terms of the level surfaces, where $f(x, y, z) = c$ with level surfaces $x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = c$. A level surface looks like concentric circles with uniform radii. 

## More than Three Variables
With more than 3 variables, even the level surfaces cannot be plotted. Hence, there'll be no way to visualize the functions.
